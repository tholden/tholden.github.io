### Tractable estimation and smoothing of highly non-linear dynamic state-space models.
> We present an algorithm for tractably estimating non-linear dynamic models, such as DSGE models with occasionally binding constraints, or stochastic volatility models. The algorithm presents an extended skew-t, augmented-state, version of the Cubature Kalman Filter of Arasaratnam and Haykin (2009) with dynamic state space reduction, to give adequate speed, and to ensure that it can handle the large state spaces generated, for example, by pruned perturbation solutions to medium-scale DSGE models. The use of an extended skew-t approximation to the state’s distribution allows the filter to also track the distribution’s third and fourth moments. We extend the base algorithm to allow for alternative cubature procedures to further improve the tracking of non-linearities. We illustrate that the method can solve some of the identification problems that plague linearized DSGE models, and show that the method can readily handle the estimation of stochastic volatility models with time varying correlation between level and volatility innovations. We go on to extend the algorithm to produce smoothed estimates of states, and we use this to assess which shocks caused the great recession in the model of Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2014).

### Learning from learners
> Traditional macroeconomic learning algorithms are misspecified when all agents are learning simultaneously. In this paper, we produce a number of learning algorithms that do not share this failing, and show that this enables them to learn almost any solution, for any parameters, implying learning cannot be used for equilibrium selection. As a by-product, we are able to show that when all agents are learning by traditional methods, all deep structural parameters of standard new-Keynesian models are identified, overturning a key result of Cochrane (2009; 2011). This holds irrespective of whether the central bank is following the Taylor principle, irrespective of whether the implied path is or is not explosive, and irrespective of whether agents’ beliefs converge. If shocks are observed then this result is trivial, so following Cochrane (2009) our analysis is carried out in the more plausible case in which agents do not observe shocks.
