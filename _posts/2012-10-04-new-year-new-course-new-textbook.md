This course is starting again, and the content of lectures will be a little different this year. But last year's slides might still be helpful, so I'm leaving them up here.



The textbook for this year is:




  * Oz Shy: “Industrial organization: Theory and applications” 338.6 SHY









  * “Goldilocks” level difficulty (I hope).

  * <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/products/catalog?q=Oz+Shy:+%E2%80%9CIndustrial+organization:+Theory+and+applications%E2%80%9D&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;gbv=2&amp;prmd=imvnso&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1183&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;cid=14792013061029424712&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yv9tUOPnCOvs0gWQ14DACg&amp;ved=0CEMQgggwAA#scoring=tps">Google shopping search. </a>




Alternative texts:




  * Jean Tirole, “The Theory of Industrial Organization” 338.6 TIR





  * A little difficult in places.



  * Jeffrey Church and Roger Ware, “Industrial Organisation: A strategic Approach"



  * Not quite right for our course, but it is available for free at: <a href="https://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=jeffrey_church">https://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=jeffrey_church</a>


Hope you enjoy the course.
