In <a href="https://www.tholden.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IO-2014-lecture-4.pdf">this topic</a> we try to answer the question: "Will profits in reality be higher or lower than under Cournot?". We begin by reminding ourselves of the origins of Cournot competition, and then go on to analyse collusion in dynamic oligopoly, and repeated games.
