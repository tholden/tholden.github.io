A few weeks ago, a journalistic article of mine on Universal Basic Income as a tool for tax and benefit reform was <a href="http://www.socialliberal.net/universal_basic_income_as_a_tool_for_tax_and_benefit_reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on Social Liberal Forum</a>.

The article is available <a href="http://www.socialliberal.net/universal_basic_income_as_a_tool_for_tax_and_benefit_reform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The aim was to sell UBI to a centrist audience.

This post also marks the first post since my major redesign of my website. What do you think?
