Most of my code is in [my personal GitHub repository](https://github.com/tholden). This includes:
  * [DynareOBC](https://github.com/tholden/dynareOBC), a toolkit for simulating models with occasionally binding constraints, and assessing their properties.
  * [DoubleDouble](https://github.com/tholden/DoubleDouble), a MATLAB library for extended ("double double") precision, giving close to quad precision.
  * [MatlabSetAffinity](https://github.com/tholden/MatlabSetAffinity), a tool for setting processor affinity for MATLAB workers.
  * [DynareTransformationEngine](https://github.com/tholden/DynareTransformationEngine), a set of mod files for automatically transforming variables and adding shocks.
  * [DynareRemoveLocalVariables](https://github.com/tholden/DynareRemoveLocalVariables, an alternative preprocessor to remove model local variables from a .mod file.
  * [ParallelFastNonLinearACD](https://github.com/tholden/ParallelFastNonLinearACD), a parallel version of Loshchilov, Schoenauer and Sebag's (2012) adaptive coordinate descent algorithm for non-linear optimization.
